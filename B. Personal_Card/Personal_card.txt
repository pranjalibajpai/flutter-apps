Stateless Widget
If we want to use Hot Reload /Hot Restart then we must define it under Satteless Widget.
In hot restart State of the app is also changed (data associated is reloaded).

Style Text
Use TextStyle Widget inside Text
eg. Text(
        'Pranjali Bajpai',
        style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 30,
        ),)

Single Child layout: Container has Child
Multi Child layout: Row/Column has children

Divider : Like horizontal rule

ListTile :
leading icon 
title Text

Card instead of Container 
to have rounded corners and card like features
doesn't has padding feature hence it's child need to be inside in Padding Widget
